*Overview

          The Carbon Footprint Tool is a simple Python application designed to calculate an individual's or
          organization's carbon footprint. It takes user inputs such as energy usage, transportation details,
          and recycling habits, then generates a report with actionable insights to reduce carbon emissions.
          Features- Calculates total carbon footprint based on user inputs.- Provides a breakdown of emissions by category (energy, transportation, 
          waste).- Generates a summary report with suggestions for reducing environmental impact.
